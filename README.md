# CECS-282-Rabbits
## Project 5

main() - Given

Fibonacci's Rabbits or better yet the numbers: 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 . . . 
This project is about that but with a twist.
What is I want to know the 3000th iteration of this sequence? Well technically if we use C++'s integers we will encounter an overflow - too many numbers for the space.

How to overcome this -> we make our own Integers called BigInt and use a map to record the number and iteration.
